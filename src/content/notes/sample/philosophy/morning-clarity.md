# Morning Clarity

The goal of this note is to test multi-paragraph blockquote extraction.

> Clarity is not found in complexity.
>
> It is found in removing what is unnecessary.
>
> Each morning, ask:
> - What truly matters?
> - What can be ignored?

Some regular paragraph text here.

> A calm mind sees structure.
>
> A noisy mind sees problems.
